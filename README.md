# Pothole-Detector-and-Filler-Bot
  Due to heavy rains, potholes on roads pose significant hazards to motorists and pedestrians, 
leading to accidents, vehicle damage, and infrastructure degradation. Traditional methods of detecting 
and filling potholes are labor-intensive, and using conventional materials like asphalt for repairs may not 
always be feasible due to resource constraints or environmental concerns. These methods are reactive, 
inefficient, and unsustainable, resulting in prolonged road closures, traffic delays, and increased 
maintenance expenditure. To address this challenge, advanced technology, sustainable materials, and 
streamlined processes are critical to revolutionizing pothole management. This approach ensures safer 
roads, reduced environmental impact, and optimized resource utilization.
Approach to solve this problem: To overcome the issue of potholes, we propose an innovative solution: a semi-autonomous bot 
equipped with ultrasonic sensors. Strategically positioned sensors detect potholes, initiating a repair 
process using a unique filling mechanism tailored to each specific hazard. Servo motors ensure precise 
filling for a controlled period. This process is repeated until the pothole is completely filled. A 
specialized roller attachment applies optimal pressure to stabilize the filled areas thoroughly, preventing 
future degradation. This approach integrates technology, precision, and sustainability to enhance road 
safety and prevent accidents.
